            <summary>Game system</summary>
            <p>In the course of your adventure, you will be required to throw dice during certain actions. You will be told which die to roll each time. For example, when making a perception roll, you'll need to roll a die of 20 (1d20). In combat, you count the damage inflicted on enemies with a die of 4 (1d4) or a die of 6 (1d6).</p>
            <p>Some rolls may receive bonuses depending on your character's characteristics and skills. For example, a character with a lot of strength can add 1 or 2 to a combat roll.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example: I roll 1d6. The result is 4. My character has a +1 strength bonus. My total result is therefore 4+1, i.e. 5. I therefore inflict 5 points of damage on my opponent.</p>
            <p>The dice rolls will also be used to determine your characters' characteristics.</p>

          <!-- Abilities and Skills -->
          <details>
            <summary>Abilities and Skills</summary>
            <p>There are 6 main characteristics: <span class="strong">Charisma</span> (Cha), <span class="strong">Constitution</span> (Con), <span class="strong">Dexterity</span> (Dex), <span class="strong">Strength</span> (Str), <span class="strong">Intelligence</span> (Int) and <span class="strong">Wisdom</span> (Wis).</p>

            <p><span class="strong">Wisdom </span>is used for the following skills: training, intuition, medicine, perception and survival.
              <ul>
                <li><span class="strong">Training: </span>Calm or train a wild or domestic animal.</li>
                <li><span class="strong">Intuition: </span>Detect the true intentions of a character or creature.</li>

              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Your score in each characteristic will be calculated by rolling 1 die of 20 for each one when you create your character in the next phase.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example: I roll 1 die of 20 for strength. I get 14. I therefore have a strength of 14.</p>

            <p>Having a high score in these characteristics gives bonuses to certain rolls. If you score between 11 and 15 for one of your characteristics, it will receive a +1 bonus for the associated skill roll.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example: I have 14 strength. I need to make an athletics roll to climb a cliff. I roll a 20. I get 12. I add a +1 bonus due to my strength. My final result is 13. </p>
            <p>If you get between 16 and 19 for one of your characteristics, it will benefit from a +2 bonus when you make an associated skill roll. If you get a score of 20 for one of your characteristics, it will benefit from a +3 bonus when you make an associated skill roll.</p>
            <p>The Constitution roll will be added to the chosen character's starting health.</p>

            <p>As for the skills, your character can choose to specialise in two of them, depending on his availability. A specialisation will automatically give you a +2 bonus on a roll.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example: I'm a barbarian who chooses to specialise in Dressage. This is a skill that depends on the Wisdom characteristic. I have a Wisdom score of 9, so I don't get a bonus. On a Dressage roll, I roll 1 die of 20. I get 7. As I'm specialised in Dressage, I can add +2 to this roll, even though I don't have a Wisdom bonus. So I get 7 + 2, or 9 for my Dressage roll. </p>

          <!-- Character Creation -->
          <details>
            <summary>Character Creation</summary>
            <p>All the manipulations for the creation of you character will be handled automatically in the next phase. You can find the principles below:</p>
            <p>You can choose between four character classes: <span class="strong">Barbarian</span>, <span class="strong">Magician</span>, <span class="strong">Monk</span> or <span class="strong">Ranger</span>. Each class starts with different health points and equipment. Each class also has different characteristics and skills. Each class starts the adventure with an explorer's bag containing <span class="strong">5 survival rations</span> and a purse. To find out how many coins you have in your purse, roll 1d20 and add 10 to the total.</p>

            <ul>

                <p>Your barbarian starts with <span class="strong">12 hp + the Constitution roll</span>.</p>
                <p class="italic">Example: I have 16 Constitution. I add my character's starting HP to this roll. 16 + 12 = 28. My character therefore has 28 HP.</p>

          </details>

          <!-- Weapons and Objects -->
          <details>
            <summary>Weapons and possessions</summary>
            <p>Your character starts out with at least one weapon. During the course of the adventure, he will be able to buy other weapons or armour depending on his level of proficiency.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><span class="strong">Light armour: </span>Leather amrour, simple amrour.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span class="strong">Heavy armour: </span>Iron armour, Chain mall.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span class="strong">Light weapons: </span>Staff (reserved for the Magician ans the Monk), Dagger, Short sword, Spear.</p>
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span class="strong">Ranged weapons </span>(for Rangers only): Longbow, Crossbow.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your character cannot carry more than one suit of armour and more than two weapons at the same time. If the adventure provides an opportunity to obtain other weapons or armour, your character will have to make a choice.</p>
            <p>As for the items, your character has an explorer's bag to carry them in. Survival rations and found objects are stored in this bag. Some special items will have to be transported differently. If this is the case, the adventure will specify it.</p>
            <p>The purse can carry no more than 50 gold coins.</p>
          </details>

          <!-- Combat system -->
          <details>
            <summary>Combat system</summary>
            <p>The adventure will always specify whether your character or your enemies should engage in combat. Combat is then turn-based. Your enemies have a certain number of HP, and so do you. You roll the dice for yourself and for your enemies too.</p>
            <p>Damage is calculated using a die of 4 for light weapons, the bow and magician's spells, and a die of 6 for heavy weapons and the crossbow. Wearing light armour protects you from 1 damage. Wearing heavy armour protects you from 2 damage but causes you to lose 1 Dexterity.</p>
            <p>If your HP drops to 0, your character will succumb to his attacks and you will have to start the adventure again. The same applies if you run out of survival rations when you need them.</p>
            <div class="italic">
              <p><span class="strong">Example 1:</span> You have 25 hp. You wear leather armour and attack with a short sword. Your opponent has 12 hp. He is not wearing armour and attacks with a longsword.</p>
              <p>On your turn: roll a die for 4. The result is 4: you inflict 4 damage. He has only 8 hp left.</p>
              <p>On his turn: roll a 6. The result is 5. As you are wearing leather armour, it protects you from 1 damage. He therefore inflicts 4 damage. You only have 21 hp left.</p>
              <p>The first to fall to 0 is considered dead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="italic">
              <p><span class="strong">Example 2:</span> You have 25 hp. You are wearing leather armour and attacking with a short sword. You have 2 opponents in front of you, each with 8 hp. They are not wearing armour and attack with a longsword.</p>
              <p>On your turn: you choose an opponent. Roll a 4. The result is 4: you inflict 4 damage. He only has 4 hp left. The other opponent is unharmed.</p>
              <p>Opponent 1's turn: roll a 6. The result is 5. As you are wearing leather armour, it protects you from 1 damage. He therefore inflicts 4 damage. You only have 21 hp left.</p>
              <p>Opponent 2's turn: roll 6. The result is 2. As you are wearing leather armour, it protects you from 1 damage. He therefore inflicts 1 damage. You only have 20 hp left.</p>
              <p>You will need to kill both enemies to defeat them. If your hp gauge falls to 0, along with those of the two enemies, you will have failed the battle.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To regain hp as your adventure progresses, you'll need to consume survival rations. One survival ration gives you 5 hp. You cannot exceed the maximum Constitution you have at the start.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example: You start with 22 hp. You lose 3 hp in a battle and decide to consume a survival ration. Your total then rises to 22 hp, not 25 hp.</p>
            <p>Make good use of your rations. They can be consumed at any time, including during combat. However, if you choose to consume a survival ration during your turn, you cannot attack.</p>
