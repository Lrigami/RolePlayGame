## About

This project is based on FreeCodeCamp's ‘RPG - Dragon Repeller’ project, which is part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification (beta). I wanted to take this project a step further by increasing its volume and offering the user a real multiple-choice RPG, with more encounters, possible endings, weapons and objects. This gave me the opportunity to master the basics of JavaScript and data management, while focusing on clean code.

I wanted to adopt the structure of a ‘Book in which you are the hero’, but based instead on the rules of a role-playing game such as Dungeons & Dragons. In addition to stamina and skill, there are the six main characteristics of Intelligence, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma and Wisdom.

Players can also choose one of four classes for their character (Barbarian, Magician, Monk or Ranger). Each class starts with different health points and equipment. Each class also brings different bonuses (e.g. characteristic modifiers, mastery of weapons or armour, specialisation in skills).

Players also have an inventory that allows them to own a maximum of one suit of armour and two weapons. They also carry items in their rucksacks, and special items otherwise. They also have a purse with a maximum of 50 gold coins.

The combat system is turn-based (the precise story begins). Damage rolls depend on the weapons the player has. Armour is used to protect against damage from the opponent(s). Survival rations allow characters to regain life and can be used in combat instead of an attack. If a character or enemy drops to 0 hit points, they are considered dead. If the player dies, they must restart the adventure.
